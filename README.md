# publisher-database-queries
SQL queries used in a publishing house's database.

One of the most extensive projects of my third semester. 
It was up to us, the students to choose a (theoretical) client for our database.
I decided on a publishing house, as the relationship between the company and authors and the 
whole process of releasing a book is really interesting, and also benefits greatly from a good database.

I began with estabilishing the client and goals of the database, then I created the ERD and RDB schemas - all in the report file.

The next part was creating the database and filling it with data - I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

Then came the most interesting part of the whole project - each one of us had to read reports of two other students and 
write queries for them (in natural language). Queries for my publisher's database were prepared by my friends Robert and Kacper and
are all written as comments in the Query.sql file. 

The last part was translating these requests to the sql language (along with three queries that I came up with). Here I was
able to use my theoretical knowledge of joins, views and other useful SQL tools in practice - all in Query.sql.
